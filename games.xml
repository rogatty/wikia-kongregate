            A hint for level 21:  Read the clue carefully, and pay close attention to the words themselves.  Eventually you&amp;#8217;ll get it ;)

        <description>Orb Avoidance is back, with a new graphical style and more changing gameplay. Mouse avoid to the next level by fighting back against your chasers and smashing them into the blocks.
            Orb Avoidance 2 tries to keep the exciting gameplay of its predecessor, but with an all new graphical design and a new change.
            Blocks can now explode after a certain amount of time, and there are special blocks that will always explode and make more orbs
            Update 2: Added another option, to turn off Orb trails so it&amp;#8217;s much faster to play in the later levels.
            IMPORTANT UPDATE (1): The game has been changed to play more like Orb 1 &amp;#8211; there is now an option to turn exploding blocks off (static balls will still explode). Trippy effects have been increased. It should also be faster laster in the game, as it has been optimized. There are two score statistics, one for exploding, and one without.
            Audio by ParagonX9
        </description>
        <instructions>Use the mouse. Lure the orbs to hit the blocks. Destroying in groups gets more points

        <description>It&amp;#8217;s a survival shooter, a turret defense game, it&amp;#8217;s so generic it&amp;#8217;s unique!
            This bad-boy gives you 8 different games in one, with a ton of options to deliver a unique experience every time you play.
            &amp;#8212;
            Fixed the same-weapon bug and tweeked some settings to make the auto-drones less dominating&amp;#8230; hope that helps balance the fun out.  Some of the games are easier than others, so you may have to try them all to find your niche ;)
            Read more about the game @ http://www.webgamemagazine.com/
        </description>
        <instructions>Use the mouse to aim, WASD to walk around in shooter mode, Q to toggle weapons and E to reload.
            If you find the game easy, or hard there are difficulty settings in the help/options menu.
            If you dislike the control scheme, you can change it in the help/options menu.

        <description>[NOW WITH MORE LEVELS]
            This is an action shooter where you have to defend your city from the alien invasion.
            The game has 15 intense levels, unique story, 6 unlockable weapons, base upgrades and 6 different enemy units.
            Beat the game and watch the great final.
            UPDATE:
            Based on the community feedback, a lot of people found this game too difficult on the first levels and easy on the last levels. Now we balanced the weapons and enemies to fix this.
            The hit area has been changed a little bit, and the weapons areas and damage has been changed also.
            TIP: Every Enemy has a weapon to defeat it, shotgun and pistol for kamikazes, rifle for bikers and cloack soldiers, rocket and laser for mech units.
            UPDATE 2
            We have added 4 new levels. If you find this game too easy, try this new version for a challenge
            UPDATE 3
            Some people said that mission 10 was way too hard. We&amp;#8217;ve tweaked it a bit to make the mission a little easer
        </description>
        <instructions>Use your mouse to aim, click to shoot, change your weapon with the 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 keys.
            You can use the mouse wheel to faster change of weapon.

            Atomic-Noodle:
            THis game took quite a while to make but end the end I&amp;#8217;m pretty happy with it. A lot of the art was done over time so some animation is better than some of the other stuff. Anyway, Enjoy :D

        <description>UPDATED (Jan 15, 2008){
            -Added new boss levels
            -Changed the movement speed to increase simplicity
            Basically, the concept of the game is a mix between a coordination game that requires you to move two different ships at the same time using a different set of keys. (w,a,s,d;i,j,k,l) and a fast shooter game with multiple enemies.
            The game features two different game modes with up to 21 levels of play.
            You will be moving two different ships around, and
            people seem to love shooting stuff, especially when it includes retro explosions!
            Have fun playing the game!
            ****NOTE****
            If the game is not loading, you might need the latest version of flash!!!

        <description>In Filler, your goal is simple: fill 2/3 of the level.  To create a filler ball, press down.  It will grow until you release the mouse button, it hits another filler ball, or a bouncing ball runs into it.
            **********
            Update (1/18): Dragging balls outside the level should now be fixed.  By popular request, the balls respawning are a little more intelligent&amp;#8212;if you&amp;#8217;re making a ball on the right side of the screen, they&amp;#8217;ll respawn top left (and vice versa).  Yay feedback!
        </description>
        <instructions>Mouse down to create a filler ball.
            Release the mouse to freeze it.
            You have a limited number of lives and balls each level.
            If you squash a bouncing ball, it will reappear at the top right corner.

        <description>Bounce, is an arcade-style action game in which players have to activate all orange balls in play by knocking into them. Your means of control is a grappling hook, and a few different power-ups to aid you. Avoid the walls.
        </description>
        <instructions>Aim with the mouse, click once to shoot grappling hook, and press again to reset/remove the hook. Hook onto balls to gain momentum and manoeuvre around the playing field by springing from ball to ball. Players will be awarded points by activating all balls on the field as quickly as possible (the faster, the more points will be awarded). Lives are lost by hitting the boundary walls or being sucked into a black hole.

            Then, each turn consists of 4 actions:
            - Place troops
            - Attacking and conquering countries

        <description>Navigate through a series of dangers like mines, lasers and rockets while opening the gate and getting to it in each level. A remake of Project Green, with massive improvements. Features an interesting highscoring system in the multiplayer with replays.
            There seems to be glitches on this site with connecting to my server and Stage height/width.. I&amp;#8217;ll be working on that.
            I may start work on the third and final version of this game soon, as I have accumulated enough programming skills to make it awesome now.
            I&amp;#8217;ll create a blog on my site in the next few days for people with ideas to explain them. So far I understand that the game needs to be:
            Easier, Less Glitchy, Have a better editor and HAVE MUSIC.
            We&amp;#8217;ll see how that goes.

        <description>Move the Earth around with the power of your mouse to dodge the waves of asteroids attracted to you by gravity. Get them in a close orbit to destroy them or pick up a Gravity Blast and shoot them out to space. The Earth will explode after 3 hits from anything so watch out!
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            For those having trouble figuring out how to get asteroids to orbit you, check out the video url below...

        <description>Drop balls on the balance.
            Every ball has a set weight so drop them wisely
            Balls affect the balance according to their distance from the fulcrum.
            Match three (or more! great bonus!) balls of the same color horizontally or vertically to make them disappear.
            Let the balance hit the ground and it’s game over.
            There are three rare powerups but their effects are unknown
        </description>
        <instructions>Move the balls with mouse, drop them with mouse button

        <description>It&amp;#8217;s about a robot that goes back in time for some reason. (His best friend is a talking pie!)
            Use your time machine to interact with past versions of yourself in this puzzle/platformer!
            You can disable the music in the options menu, or by right-clicking.
            IF YOU CAN&amp;#8217;T SAVE: Right click on the game, select &amp;#8220;settings&amp;#8221;. Click on the folder, and slide the bar to the right. Flash has a limit to how much data you can store per site, and you guys have been playing too many games on Kong! =P
        </description>
        <instructions>Arrows or WASD to move, space bar to lift crates and use your time pod. Each level contains a puzzle that must be solved by interacting with past versions of yourself. The game records your movements. When you use the Time Pod to travel back to the beginning of the level, you see a past version of yourself doing exactly what you did before entering the pod. You can create as many copies of yourself as you need to solve the puzzle, but be careful not to change the past too much. If you interfere with a past self&amp;#8217;s ability to return to the Time Pod, you cause a PARADOX!

        <instructions>Requires latest flash player so make sure you update.
            In game tutorial has instructions. Control your avatar with wasd or the arrow keys. Spacebar pauses. You can hold down ctrl when you select to pick the building under the cursor no matter how crowded a tile is. Pressing escape or x clears current selection. Basic strategy is to build lairs which produce creatures to fight back the hordes. Your avatar will die if left alone so make sure you watch his hit points. Keep ranged avatars out of the path of the enemy so they don&amp;#8217;t get run over!  For a list of updates you can go to greyhoundgames.com New version with new features. Win\lose screen and square radiuses for melee lairs to make it easier to line up multiple melee lairs.

        <description>Defend your Orbit by building up an impenetrable stronghold and hold back the enemy waves!
            Inspired by Space Invaders and Tetris, Orbitron is a mix between a shooter and a defense game. Prove your shooting and defense building skills in 34 challenging levels!
            Tips:
            Focus on staying alive rather than chasing down every enemy; Your Orbit has 40 lives and can be easily repaired, while you only got 3.
            Only killing will earn you money; so don&amp;#8217;t just build walls and let the enemies collide, you will soon run out of money.
            Build strategically; build non-permeable walls under your turrets, if you&amp;#8217;re afraid of shooting them. Also, an Amplifier above a Turret is also a good idea.
            [Update 23.10.07] &amp;#8211; fixed the bug at the end of game
            [Update 24.10.07] &amp;#8211; improved performance

        <description>Fill 80% of the stage with colors while avoiding collisions with enemies in this happy arcade flash game!
            You can now find the sequel, named Colourfill, on the App Store for iPhone and the Google Play Store for Android! Enjoy :)
            *Update: I fixed the bug where the timer did not stop when the game was over or the level completed.
            I also made the lines grow faster so the game is easier now. Any comment on that change is greatly appreciated.
            Thanks!
        </description>
        <instructions>Avoid collisions with enemies while your cursor is extending, trap enemies inside colors but avoid trapping them in their own colors!

            If you&amp;#8217;re finding the controls awkward, PLEASE use the &amp;#8216;reverse controls&amp;#8217; option before moaning and whining about it.
            There are 8 different &amp;#8216;pwer-ups&amp;#8217;, which can have good or bad effects, depending on your situation I suppose.
            This took about 2 weeks to make, at a rough estimate. I&amp;#8217;m proud of what I&amp;#8217;ve created.

        <description>Battalion: Nemesis puts you in command of the Rapid Attack and Response unit commanded by Sergeant Tucker. Face off against the insidious Mullen in an epic 10 level campaign!
            There are a total of 16 levels to be played, where you can master the rules of tactical turn-based strategy combat.
            Saving Information:
            Your inter-level mission progress will be saved when you finish a level. If you beat a level, you should not need to beat it again. Choosing &amp;#8220;Save and Quit&amp;#8221; from the options menu in the middle of the mission will create a restore point. If you click on &amp;#8220;Resume Save Point&amp;#8221; on the title screen, the game will be restored to that save point. If you play a game on a different level or map, your resume point will be lost.

        </description>
        <instructions>As the note markers hit the bar at the bottom of the fret board, press the corresponding key (A, S, D or F) in time with the track; the more accurate you are the more points you&amp;#8217;ll score. If you keep hitting the notes accurately you&amp;#8217;ll build up your combo which will multiply the points awarded even further. Keep the performance bar to the right of the fret board out of the red to clear the level and progress through the game. Clear all five levels to earn the title of &amp;#8220;Guitar Geek&amp;#8221;! For those players looking for a quality option, the quality is automatically set to &amp;#8220;low&amp;#8221; as the game doesn&amp;#8217;t use vector graphics, and so changing the quality would make no difference.

        <description>Squiggle Squid is a mouse-controlled action puzzle game where you control the son of the Kraken as he seeks the legendary Coral Crown.
            Use Squiggle Squid&amp;#8217;s ink dash to collect plankton and avoid ocean obstacles such as spiny sea urchins. But it won&amp;#8217;t be easy! As the level goals increase, you must master the ink dash to make huge chains, collect power-ups and avoid dangerous sea life.
            Complete the 50-level Quest Mode or go for the top score in Score Mode.
        </description>
        <instructions>Click away from Squiggle Squid and he will dash and make an ink cloud. Collect plankton when your ink cloud touches them. The farther you dash, the bigger the ink cloud. Quickly dash and make chains for big points.

        <description>The popularity of sniper games has always fascinated me. After countless hours of research, I have determined that this is what you want. Note: to get the &amp;#8220;Too Cool for Light&amp;#8221; badge, you must put your shades on before the first mission. Do not remove them until you have completed the game, even between missions. If you have put the shades on and removed them, reset your game in the trophy room.

        <description>Robots are tired of doing the bidding of their human masters and they’ve figured it’s finally time to overthrow them. In this engaging arcade puzzler, it’s your job to protect humanity from the endless robotic horde. Take down wave after wave of robots, collect powerups and save the world in the Crowd Control play mode. Or, seek out and destroy the leaders of the insurrection in Assassination mode.
        </description>
        <instructions>In Crowd Control, click to start drawing a rectangular electrocution field and click to use the power surge when all 4 corners have the same robot color.
            In Assassination, click to shoot a robot. The target will glow red when you kill an innocent, so look for him in the darkness and then kill him once you have exposed him.
            RIGHT-CLICK: This opens the settings menu, that lets you toggle sound, and do other fun stuff.

        <description>Trapped within the dark and eerie confines of an abandoned bomb shelter, you must make you way to the deepest level, kill the carrier of the alien strain, and get out alive.


            Inasmuch as we would like to accommodate all your suggestions, the overall game design however prevents us from doing so without extensively modifying the game engine.  We really appreciate all your feedbacks and will try to include them in this version of the game or future versions/sequels of it.

        <description>What would Death himself do if he were surrounded by ultra-cute critters? Kill them, of course! You play the reaper, who needs to kill red cuties in order to stay alive. Killing other cuties will help charge super powers that make it easier to get to the red cuties. How long can you survive before the dwindling cutie population stifles your life? You can&amp;#8217;t help but have a bloody fun day in this addictive puzzler.
        </description>
        <instructions>You are the Reaper! Click an adjacent hexagon to attack it. Click one of the buttons along the button to activate your special power (if it has powered up).
            Your health decreases every time you make an attack, but killing red cuties will give you back health.

        <description>Hi all!
            This is our new game, which is kind of a good-old Zelda-like adventure game. We made it very retro-fashioned on purpose, to bring back the “magic” of the 80’s games. The game has a decent length if you want to complete everything in it, which should take around 20 to 25 hours, or more like 10 to 15 hours for a first run just trying to beat it.
            You’ll need to defeat monsters along the way of the outside world to find dungeons where quest items (or treasures) are kept safe by big monsters. Those relics are then used to grant passage to the evil Gordzak’s lair, which you’ll have to destroy in order to beat the game. To accomplish this you will need to upgrade your gear and your personal strength by leveling up and finding magic items.
            Have fun!

        <description>Shoot up the enemy, pick up special weapons, and blast your way through 6 intense battles based on the story from Renegade Commanders. This epic driving game has tons to offer with unlockable game perks and Stamina Modes that allow you to compete for high scores. This game is highly addictive and is packed with instant action!
            The game uses a classic mode7 3D effect to bring the early console action feel to the web. The playing experience is pretty intense with glass shattering explosions and in your face bullet holes.
            The story line takes you into the mind of a soldier stuck in the Renegade war (for the full story play Renegade Commanders). Your fellow soldiers suddenly turn Renegade (almost too suddenly to be normal) and you must fight your way to destroy every last one of them.
            I had a lot of fun developing the game. Have fun playing!

        <description>Throw the blocks together to create chains of 3+, and stack up those chains to unlock higher bonuses. The blocks fall relentlessly from above, let them stack too high and it&amp;#8217;s game over.
            I was inspired by a combination of Match-3 games, the Sega classic Columns and a little bit of Tetris when making this game.
            Be warned: Hard to play on a laptop / trackpad!
        </description>
        <instructions>Use the mouse. Click and drag the blocks. Release them to throw. Match 3+ of the same color to make them vanish. A Chain Bonus multiplier is awarded if you manage to destroy 3+ blocks quickly enough in succession.

        <description>Take command of the mighty Warmachine and lead your troops to victory in the latest chapter of the Battalion saga. Battalion: Skirmish is a 1-level preview of Battalion&amp;#8217;s improved graphics and game engine, which you will see featured in upcoming multiplayer and single-player Battalion titles this summer! In this turn-based combat strategy game, you must prevent the Warmachine, the new backbone of the Northern Federation forces, from falling into the hands of the traitor General Mullen. The Akadians are coming. Without the Warmachine, your armies will be powerless to stop them.
        </description>
        <instructions>Click on an active unit once to select it. Now click an open tile to move to it, or an enemy unit to attack it. Click on an active unit twice to open its special action menu. This is how you access the Warmachine&amp;#8217;s build action, which will be critical to your success. You can also use this special action menu to repair units that have been damaged in combat.

        <description>Raider is an old-school platformer experience that will consist of five separate episodes, eventually.
            You play as a character called Arkus Zei: a &amp;#8216;space pirate&amp;#8217; who makes a living by searching for loot in abandoned wrecks of dead spaceships and such.
            It&amp;#8217;s meant to be DIFFICULT, and it&amp;#8217;s meant to be simple and straightforward; there are no gimmicky features or unnecessary frills, just basic platformer goodness. You can jump, shoot and slash and that&amp;#8217;s it, and all you have to do is get to the end of the level and beat the boss. Simple. Or is it?
            There are also hidden &amp;#8216;relic&amp;#8217; items for you to find, and you get a Rank at the end of the level based on your performance, adding replayability.
        </description>
        <instructions>IMPORTANT: The controls can be CUSTOMISED! Just click on &amp;#8216;How to Play&amp;#8217; on the main menu, and there you&amp;#8217;ll find a &amp;#8216;Configure&amp;#8217; option.
            Use the Arrow Keys to move.
            A, S and D are the other controls.
            SPACE pauses the game.
            While paused, use ESC to return to the main menu.
            Use Z to skip dialogue, and ENTER to skip the cutscene thing at the start if you don&amp;#8217;t want to read.

        <description>Guide the demon on his path to locating the reincarny Riley and taking him back to hell with you.
            Be sure to play the first game to know what is going on.  However, it can still be fun without knowing too.
            Question to all fans of the game:  Would you like a 3rd one, and if so, would you rather it take place in a circus or a voodoo town?  Either way i got some really cool ideas for it.
            Update &amp;#8211; 4-21-09
            The people have spoken and I have listened.  I&amp;#8217;ve had the locker recoded to make it easier.  As far as the maze goes,  when i originally wrote the game back in 2008 I thought the maze would of been a fun idea.  It was a pain not only for my coder, but you guys as well and I&amp;#8217;ll never do a maze again.  I&amp;#8217;m sorry!

        <description>Disclaimer: This game is very difficult.
            Sir Reginald MoneySeize II, Esq. must collect coins to fund construction of the tallest tower in the world!
            Jump through stages ranging from simple to ridiculously difficult in your quest to find all 1010 coins.
            Use your jump, double jump, wall jump and skid jump to traverse the dangerous terrain of the game&amp;#8217;s 50 stages (40 regular, 10 secret).
            The soundtrack (including source files) is downloadable from this post on my blog: http://mattmakesgames.com/blog/2009/07/moneyseize-released-soundtrack.html
        </description>
        <instructions>Arrows to move, S or Space to jump.  Up to enter doors.
            TIP: If you&amp;#8217;re having a hard time with a level, try only going for a couple coins at a time rather than all at once.  Doing 5 runs of a level grabbing 5 coins each time is much easier than one monster run for all 25 in one shot.

        <description>An homage to and affectionate light parody of &amp;#8216;retro RPGs&amp;#8217;, but a full, deep game in itself, with many hours of gameplay.

            And some people thought this would never come out! But hey, look! It did! Gasp.
            This is the longly-delayed third chapter in the MARDEK saga. Numerous setbacks have caused it to take years to complete.
            It&amp;#8217;s a long game, and since it&amp;#8217;s a full RPG, it requires a lot of time to play through fully. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of talking.
            There may be bugs. Please report any that you find and I&amp;#8217;ll try to upload an update as quickly as I can. If you do report bugs though, please try to reproduce them and tell me HOW you get them to occur.

        <description>Help the demon capture three Reincarnies in this third installment of the series!
            Well, it has been over a year since I have started this game.  You can actually see how much has changed since the start of this game by playing the past couple of minis.  I&amp;#8217;m sorry for the long wait and I hope it was worth it.
            This time the demon is sent to capture 3 Reincarnies who are now hiding out in New Orleans, Louisiana.   Find out if they are up to no good and send them back to hell to please Luke!
            I restarted the kickstarter.com project if you want to redonate @ http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1878730846/reincarnation-bring-evil-to-life
            There are 10 medals in this game.

        <description>In the far future, Earth is destroyed by decades of war for resources.
            The survivors build huge motherships and depart for a journey to the stars, yet the Human learn that they are not alone as they encounter the dreadful, bionic Xeyed and the mysterious Awlon…
            Build 21 different ships, each with its own special abilities, from 3 unique races and use 15 different mothership specials in this challenging 3D rendered real time strategy game!
            Unlock bonus levels and special achievements, and choose from over 100 upgrades throughout the game to upgrade your ships!
        </description>
        <instructions>If the game is too large for your computer, then zoom out in your browser!
            How to zoom out in Internet Explorer:
            Press CTRL + PLUS SIGN (+) to zoom in, or CTRL + HYPHEN (-) to zoom out. You can also use your mouse wheel instead of + and -.
            Sound/Quality: Press the &amp;#8216;Menu&amp;#8217; button or the &amp;#8216;P&amp;#8217; key on the upper left side of the screen while in the game (playing a level, not on the main map).
            All settings can be found there.
            Scroll:  Left/Right keys or Mouse
            Choose lane: Up/Down keys or Mouse
            Select ship type in build menu (top left):
            Q/W keys
            or hotkey displayed on ship icon
            or click on ship icon
            Build selected ship on chosen lane:
            Space
            or click
            Release Mothership specials in specials menu (top right):
            Number keys displayed on special icons
            or click on the specials icon on the top right
            Take time to figure out which controls work best for you. Some prefer playing with mouse and keyboard while others use only keyboard. You can disable the mouse controls in the ingame menu is you don&amp;#8217;t want to use them.
            IMPORTANT: If the game runs slowly, decrease the quality in the ingame menu.
            If you have a fast computer turn on the &amp;#8216;Trails&amp;#8217; in the ingame menu to get awesome graphics.
            If you think the game is too easy try the hard mode.

        <description>Fun and unique 2D strategy game. Lead your cute 5-man band on a quest to exterminate all the monsters in the land. Features random quests and 12 bosses. You can also pit your armies against your friends in the unique multiplayer mode!
            Public Service Announcement: Over 29.5 MILLION monsters have been killed since this game was released. :D
            Author&amp;#8217;s Note: The previous game, Bongo Boom Battlegrounds, was indeed an attempt to introduce a Patapon-like game to Flash, because none existed. Monster Slayers builds on the strengths of the PC, removes the rhythm bits, and adds a different kind of multiplayer. :)
            If you are looking for more hats, grab them by defeating other players in multiplayer mode. You get one free hat when you click the Tip Me button, too! And no, the tip itself isn&amp;#8217;t compulsory. :)
            More notes: There&amp;#8217;s actually a theme to the 12 boss monsters. Two themes, actually. Think about it carefully when you finish the game, it&amp;#8217;s my own little attempt at Fridge Brilliance. :p

        <description>It has been 2 years (released the first one on 10/29/2008) since I have started making the Reincarnation series, and I wanted to share with everyone a special Halloween episode in honor of the 2 year anniversary.
            It was kind of a rush job (finished making the game in less than a month), but I feel it came out very well.
            Thanks for being supportive!

            Face off against new enemies such as commander penguins, the hard-to-topple elite penguins and Professor Von Byrdbrynn, Der Feather&amp;#8217;s scientist. Use new tools such as rockets, balloons, rubber boxes, or the futuristic floating board to complete 26 penguin-crashing, joke filled levels.
            Crash yourself onto military trucks, funpark rides, giant propellers, and other dangerous-looking contraptions scattered throughout the game to help you in your penguin ass-kicking mission.

            &amp;#8220;My Little Army is a very customizable war game that follows much in the steps of the Epic War series, but brings many new features to the table!&amp;#8221;

            Your army can be customized on the &amp;#8220;formation&amp;#8221; page by mixing each unit&amp;#8217;s 3 attributes: class, character, and weapon.
            Class determines the unit&amp;#8217;s role on the battlefield. Different classes also use unique weapon types.
            The &amp;#8220;character&amp;#8221; attribute determines the unit&amp;#8217;s appearance and base stats.
            Weapons each have their own stats and attack types.

        <description>From the makers of &amp;#8220;I Have 1 Day&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t Shit Your Pants&amp;#8221; comes a new take on Tower Defense. This is a Tower Conquest. Be the villian instead of the hero, siege instead of defend, and take over the world, one kingdom at a time.
            Rather than building towers and defending against hordes of monsters, you are given the reins of an evil mage that builds his army from the ground up to dominate the lands. You must unlock new units, learn new spells, and think up unique summoning strategies to overcome the defenses of your foes.

        <description>Dead Metal is a top down shooter set in space, built off our powerful BT3 game engine.  In fact, summing it up as Bubble Tanks in space with Star Forge art would be a pretty good way to describe it.  The game was a result of just tinkering with the game engine and seeing what we could do. Once we were flying around launching missiles and blowing stuff up, we agreed- this is awesome.
            The game features over 30 unique enemy types across 5 races as well as 10 avatar ships with extremely varied weapons.  The last mission is a survival mission, see how long you can last as hordes of enemy capital ships come down upon you and get the best score possible.
            The game saves after each mission completed.
            Enjoy!

            My tips for beating 2 swordsmen standing right next to each other:
            a) Use shield to get close then break a knee of one, then back away and then kill the other.
            b) use a running shield bash to knock over one, then kill the other
            c) use a jumping attack to kill one of them.
            d) Throw a spear at them
            e) kick a head at them to knock one over and kill the other

        <description>Head back into the fray and save Arkandia again this time against the Revenant!
            Embark on your journey as either an Arkandian or Necretian(Or even a Demon/Ascended if you&amp;#8217;ve completed the previous chapter), save the world and also fill your coinpurse!
            Aided by your new friend Billy, crawl down into the deepest of dungeons and recover long lost artifacts, use them to destroy your enemies personally or even equip them onto you personal army and engage in large scale tactical combat.
            Or if you prefer uncover the hidden secrets of crafting and outfit your warriors with your own crafted weapons and armour while you quaff home made potions.
            Revenant takes everything that made Crusade great and expands it to a whole new level. The Arkandian Legends are a series of stories that you the player live through. Achievements, skills, items and victories in one story follow you through to the next, unlocking new features and advantages as you go.
            Your actions will determine the course of your adventures and the choices you make can change the very nature of the world.

            Unfortunately, a completely unintentional but unfixable side-effect of me adding updates to the game is that you will lose your save progress, if you get fed up with trying to beat the same packs over and over again, there is always the level editor!

        <description>Episode 2 in the Raider series; there&amp;#8217;ll be five in total.
            The games are meant to be difficult platformers reminiscent of the NES/SNES days, with graphics to suit that. You don&amp;#8217;t have loads of fancy overpowered abilities; just a simple blaster and a sword. Can you reach the end of the level?
            This carries on the story from episode 1.
        </description>
        <instructions>A is jump,
            S is slash,
            D is shoot,
            UP is used for ladders, signs and doors (which is why it&amp;#8217;s not jump!),
            The other arrow keys are used for movement,
            and SPACE pauses.
            Use Z to back out of menus and things if you can see no other way to do so.
            The controls may be atypical, but they are designed to be streamlined. If you take a few moments to get used to them, you will find that they are easier to use than the more &amp;#8216;standard&amp;#8217; Flash platformer control schemes.
            Also, if you STILL don&amp;#8217;t like them, PLEASE do not rate the game down for this, because you can CHANGE the controls from the &amp;#8216;Game Info&amp;#8217; section on the Main Menu.

            License and become the envy of Atlantic fishermen everywhere?
            Game includes five fishing spots, five different types of lure (each with their own method of attracting game), and 68 types of fish to catch.

        <description>What is Platcore?! Well Platcore is a platformer/avoid style of gameplay, you play as a Platbot which is a testing robot for Platcore, and Platcore will be using you to test out their newest products, which come in the form of things which aren&amp;#8217;t exactly your friend (Lasers, turrets, even bigger lasers, and evil things!). You play in a test chamber and your sole aim is to stay alive and survive the testing procedures, remember though, your robot is dispensable so there are MANY robots to play as if yours gets destroyed.
            The games soundtrack is synced up to the Platcore AI, so when the soundtrack goes boom, something else is going boom, and it&amp;#8217;s likely to hit you in the face.
            So this has been in development for quite a while in 2011 and has had a crazy rollercoaster ride in the development process as I ended up quitting my job mid-development so I could work full time on what I love; Giving you guys content! And then the sponsorship process was a rollercoaster in itself of a few months negotiating and falling through deals so I&amp;#8217;m like extactic to be able to release this. And I hope you like it as much I as did developing it!
            If you chose the wrong control scheme, just reload the game and you&amp;#8217;ll be able to pick it again! :)
            Be warned, if you skip through the tutorial &amp;#8211; you can&amp;#8217;t get it back without deleting your save file! So read!

            Customise your Platbots in the Lab.
            If you&amp;#8217;re experiencing lag &amp;#8211; right click and turn the quality down! This is important as a few people experience lag for a reason unknown to me!

            The long awaited sequel to Epic Battle Fantasy 3!
        </description>
        <instructions>Everything is controlled with the mouse, but you can also move around with the keyboard.
            You can change the controls, quality, sounds and other stuff in the options menu.
            Protip: Deleting cookies can delete your saves, so don&amp;#8217;t do that. Chrome&amp;#8217;s especially great at deleting your saves.
            Updated to version 1.0.7! The only difference is that I&amp;#8217;ve changed the compression method to something older. This means the game is slightly bigger, but it might fix some compatibility problems. Most people probably won&amp;#8217;t notice a difference though. If you do, tell me plz.
